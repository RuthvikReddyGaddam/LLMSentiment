## Movie Recommendation System Using LangChain & Hugging Face

- Developed a movie recommendation system using LangChain and Hugging Face pre-trained models.
 
- Implemented zero-shot classification to categorize movies into five genres using LLMs based on plot descriptions.
 
- Utilized sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to generate movie embeddings for similarity-based recommendations.
 
- Built a Chroma vector database to efficiently store and retrieve movie embeddings for recommendations.

- Processed and indexed large-scale text data (movie descriptions) using LangChain's text splitting and embedding techniques.

This is a work in progress!
